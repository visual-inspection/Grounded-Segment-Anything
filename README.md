# Grounded-Segment-Anything

This repository does not represent a fork, but rather an adaptation of the original to our needs.
It was created mainly to simplify the mass-processing of images using a single text prompt.

There are two new scripts:

  - `process_sam.py`
  - `process_sam_with_masks.py`
